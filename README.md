# Philosophical Gourmet Report - Personal Rankings

This is a simple notebook which takes data scraped from the Philosophical Gourmet Report (saved here in tsv and json formats), filters them by ordered rank, and visualizes them interactively using Perspective.

## Getting Started
You will need python installed. I'm assuming you're using a unix-like machine.

Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
python -m venv ./venv
# run this every time you need to use the project
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-lab
```
